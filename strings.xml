    <string name="aboutZW">Zero Waste means that nothing is sent to a landfill. In other words,
     all waste is either recycled or composted. Usually, the main thing to tackle is plastic.
    Every piece of plastic every made still exists today, and 8 million tons of plastic enter the ocean
    each year. Going zero waste allows one to reduce their footprint on the Earth by choosing sustainable,
     natural items that won't end up in a landfill, or worse, the ocean. </string>
    <string name="secondParagraph">The first step to changing our habits is becoming aware of them. By logging
    your interactions with items in your daily life, you can gain an understanding of where most of your
    waste is coming from. Then the real change can take place! Use the Browse section to explore products and
    recipes for reducing your waste, and use the analysis section to get personalized recommendations.</string>
